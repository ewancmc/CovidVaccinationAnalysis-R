# CovidVaccinationAnalysis-R

In this analysis I will be investigating the Our World in Data COVID-19 Database (Mathieu et al., 2020) to explore the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations, new cases, and deaths, in Australia through the following questions:

1. What is the sum of new vaccinations, cases, and deaths by month
2. How the rates of cases and deaths changed over time
3. How the vaccination rate relates to disease outcomes (e.g. cases, deaths)
4. How Australia's vaccination rate compares to the top 3 countries with the highest number of deaths
